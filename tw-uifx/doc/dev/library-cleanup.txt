1) synchronize all projects with file system (F5, refresh)
2) wipe out ivy cache (delete local and cache directories)
3) delete all content in lib directories of all projects
4) regenerate all jars, THEN run ivy>refresh on every project, all this in dependency order 
6) delete tw-dep.jar, ModelMaker.jar and ModelRunner.jar
7) regenerate them with TwSetup (few minutes)

if I edit the timeLine after having edited the StoppingCondition endTime, the time scale in Stoppingcondition doesnt get updated (eg switching from MONO_UNIT to GREGORIAN in timeline doenst affect StoppingCondition which still displays MONO_UNIT)
