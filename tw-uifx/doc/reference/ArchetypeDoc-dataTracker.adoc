_Properties for_ `dataTracker`:

[horizontal]
`samplingMode`:: This property specifies how to pick system components for data tracking _within a group_. The data will be either (1) selected for one particular system component within each group, or (2) taken from that group’s own data, if any (e.g. species population size), or (3) aggregated using some statistical method ; all this, depending on the cross-links of the `dataTracker`. For (1), the default behaviour is that once a system component is selected, it will be tracked until its deletion by the simulator. In all cases, remember that the maximal number of data tracking channels is set by the `sampleSize` property; this property only tells the software how to fit the data coming from possibly many system components into the requested number of output channels.

`sampleSize`:: How many system components at most will be tracked. Valid values are any positive integer or the keyword `ALL` to sample all the components of a given group.

`statistics`:: This property lists transformations of the raw data to compute when a group contains more than one system component.

`tableStatistics`:: This property lists transformations of the raw data to compute in case of a table variable. The grouping is determined by the index specification in the track variable list.
