_Properties for_ `dataTracker`:

[horizontal]
`track`:: This property specifies the list of variables that should be tracked by this datatracker

`groupBy`:: This property specifies how many tracking channels should be created for a tracked variable, depending on groups their containing system components belong to.

include::ArchetypeDoc-dataTracker-Grouping.adoc[]
****

`select`:: This property specifies how to pick system components for data tracking _within a group_. The data will be either (1) selected for one particular system component within each group, or (2) taken from that groupâ€™s own data, if any (e.g. species population size), or (3) aggregated using some statistical method. For (1), the default behaviour is that once a system component is selected, it will be tracked until its deletion by the simulator. In all cases, remember that the maximal number of data tracking channels is set by the `groupBy` property; this property only tells the software how to fit the data coming from possibly many system components into the requested number of channels.

`viewOthers`:: This property specifies if an extra tracking channel must be created for system components that are not part of a selection. If set to `true`, the statistics property is required and will apply to all system components outside the selection.

`stageList`:: This property contains the list of stage names to be tracked.

`speciesList`:: This property contains the list of species names to be tracked.

`individualList`:: This property contains the list of individual system component to be tracked

`statistics`:: This property lists transformations of the raw data to compute when a group contains more than one system component

include::ArchetypeDoc-dataTracker-StatisticalAggregates.adoc[]
****

`tableStatistics`:: This property lists transformations of the raw data to compute in case of a table variable. The grouping is determined by the index specification in the track variable list.
