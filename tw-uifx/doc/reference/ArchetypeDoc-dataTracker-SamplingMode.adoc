_possible values_:

[horizontal]
`RANDOM`:: selects a random system component in each group (default value)
`FIRST`:: selects the first system component in each group as stored in the simulator’s lists (quite unpredictable unless there is only one item in the list)
`LAST`:: selects the last system component in each group as stored in the simulator’s lists (quite unpredictable unless there is only one item in the list)
`AGGREGATE`:: computes a statistical aggregate of tracked variables for all members of each group (i.e., all system components of the group are tracked)
`GROUP`:: tracks the data of that group, if available (typically, group size, number of new and deleted members)
