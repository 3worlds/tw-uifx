Simulators usually rely on possibly large data sets to initialise and run a simulation. 

==== Data uses

According to their use during a simulation, we can classify data into:

[horizontal]
Parameters:: Values usually visible to a large number of system components that remain constant over a simulation or over the life time of an ephemeral component. These are stored in the <<truethe-systemstructure-node,constants>> of components, groups, life cycles and the arena. 
+
__Examples__: the _average solar radiation at the top of the canopy_ for the arena component; the _spatial coordinates_ of a plant; the _species name_ for a group of components.

Initial community:: In most cases a simulation must start with a non-empty initial system. This implies that components be instantiated with specific initial values for their <<truethe-systemstructure-node,drivers>> and proper connections between them.
+
__Examples__: an initial forest reconstructed from LIDAR data; a monitored population of marked animals within an area, where each animal has a measured age.

Forcing data:: Sometimes a simulation requires that data be fed in during its time course, at some time step, replacing values of a driver that cannot be computed by the model.
+
__Examples__: a series of metorological data used to force a fire spread or a vegetation growth model.

Data for _parameters_ and _initial community_ are directly used to instantiate components and fill their descriptors with values. _Forcing data_ must be loaded into some initial data structure (probably most often a `DoubleTable`, cf. <<truetable>>, as a constant in the `system` instance), made accessible to some user-defined function that will read its content as the simulation proceeds.

==== Data input methods

There are three different ways of feeding `ModelRunner` with data to start a simulation experiment (cf. <<truethe-setup-of-an-initial-state-for-a-simulation>> for the specification of these):

. Entering parameter and initial driver values in the model configuration tree. This is useful only for small quantities of data, (i) with models requiring only a few parameters, or (ii) during the initial building/testing file of a model; typically when one does not want to bother with formatting an input file with only two parameter values. This is specified using `initialValues` nodes as children of `system`, `componentType`, `groupType` or `lifeCycleType`, depending on where the data should go (<<truethe-system-node>> and <<configuration-ecosystem-structure.adoc#truethe-systemstructure-node>>).
. Loading data from an external source, typically, one or more files. This is recommended whenever a large number of initial values and items must be used. This is specified using `loadFrom` cross-links to `dataSource` nodes (<<configuration-experiment.adoc#trueinputs-datasource>>).
. Using a user-defined initialiser function to set or modify initial values. This complements both points above and enables to compute transformations of initial drivers or constants prior to run the simulation. This is specified using `initFunction` nodes of the `SetInitialState` type (<<configuration-ecosystem-dynamics.adoc#truefunction>>) as children of `system`, `componentType`, `groupType` or `lifeCycleType`, depending on where the data should go (<<truethe-system-node>> and <<configuration-ecosystem-structure.adoc#truethe-systemstructure-node>>). 

These three methods can be used together within the same model. However, since an initialiser function must be run on an existing instance of a component, it can only be used (i) on the `system` node, which is always instantiated and unique, or (ii) as a complement to the two other methods which can specify the component instances to create.


===== The _loadFrom_ cross-link

`loadFrom -> dataSource:<__name__>` {0..*}::

A `dataSource` node specifies the information required to access some data source: for example, a file name, a file format, and all other requested information that the java code just needs to read the file.

A `loadFrom` cross-link links the `system`, a `componentType`, `groupType` or `lifeCycleType` a to a data source.

===== The _initialValues_ node

`/3worlds/.../componentType/*initialValues*:<__name__>`

`/3worlds/.../groupType/*initialValues*:<__name__>`

`/3worlds/.../lifeCycleType/*initialValues*:<__name__>`

`/3worlds/system/*initialValues*:<__name__>`

An `initialValues` node enables one to directly specify the number, driver and constant values, belonging to groups and life cycle instances, of initial instances of components, groups, life cycle, and the arena.

_Properties for_ `initialValues` :

[horizontal]
`nInstances`:: The number of instances of `componentType`, `groupType` or `lifeCycleType` to create at the start of the simulation. For groups and life cycle, the instance name will be the name of the initialValues node, plus a number if more than one instance is required. For components, the unique identifier is automatically generated. Note that a value of zero will not create any instance. Ignored for the arena (always present and unique).
`idGroup`:: (only applies to `.../groupType/componentType/initialValues` nodes): The `groupType` instance name of these `ComponentType` instances
`idLifeCycle`:: (only applies to `.../lifeCycleType/groupType/componentType/initialValues` and `.../lifeCycleType/groupType/initialValues` nodes): The `lifeCycleType` instance name of these `ComponentType` or `groupType` instances
`<__name__>`:: driver and constant (name,value) pairs to populate the instances. The property name must match a declared field. Tables are not supported. 

CAUTION: The latter property is only partly supported and at the time of writing, `ModelMaker` does not enable one to write such properties. One has to edit the configuration file by hand. Only do that if you are an expert.

===== The _initFunction_ node

`/3worlds/.../componentType/*initFunction*:<__name__>`

`/3worlds/.../groupType/*initFunction*:<__name__>`

`/3worlds/.../lifeCycleType/*initFunction*:<__name__>`

`/3worlds/system/*initFunction*:<__name__>`

_Properties for_ `initFunction` :

[horizontal]
`type`:: The type of function used: only <<configuration-ecosystem-dynamics.adoc#truefunction,`setInitialState`>> is possible.

`functionSnippet`:: The java code to be inserted into the body of the `initFunction` method in the generated code.

_Cross-links for_ `initFunction`:

`useRNG -> rng:<__name__>` {0..1}::
Points to the <<configuration-dataDefinition.adoc#truerandom-number-channels,random number generator channel>> to use in this function. If unset, the default random number channel is used.


==== Consistency of data files with the model component hierarchy

The simulated system is a hierarchy with up to 4 levels: arena > life cycle > group > component (cf. Box <<system-howto>>). As a consequence, input data files must reflect this hierarchy.


==== Data file formats

The data file formats currently supported as input to 3Worlds are listed in <<configuration-experiment.adoc#trueinputs-datasource>>. At the moment, `.csv` text files and `.ods` spreadsheet files are supported. Their content must comply with constraints listed in <<configuration-experiment.adoc#trueinputs-datasource>>.

For a practical understanding of how this works, we recommend to run the `TestDataLoading` model (accessible in *ModelMaker* through the `Projects > New > Test cases` menu). 

Here are examples extracted  from this test model:

====== Example 1: using a _dataSource_ only

This `.ods` spreadsheet:

image::configuration-experimentIMG/example-spreadsheet-climate.png[align="center"]

with the following specifications: 

image::configuration-experimentIMG/example-climate2.png[align="center"]
image::configuration-experimentIMG/example-climate1.png[align="center"]

will result in the instantiation of a single system component with id **49**, belonging to category **climate**, with an elaborate data structure as shown on the graph, containing a table *otherVar* of dimensions *[12,8]* with values read from the *climat.ods* file (from debugger):
[source,]
----
container:sys1[
  categories:[[category:*arena*], ...]
  local_items:{
    49=[SystemComponent:49
      otherVar={[12,8],(8 3.1 C),(0 2.9 C),(2 5.3 C),(0 3.1 C),
                       (16 3.9 C),(17 3.9 C),(5 2.0 C),(17 2.6 C),
                       (0 1.2 C ,(0 0.4 C)...} 
      temperature={[12,8],21.8,21.4,23.0,24.0,19.4,20.5,22.0,
                          18.0,21.3,22.5...}
    ]
  }
  ...
]
----

How?

* property  `subclass` in `dataSource:climateData` tells *ModelMaker* that the file to be read is in `.odf` format. Since there is no `sheet` property, only the first (actually, only) sheet is read;
* property `file` gives the name of the file to read, here **climat.ods**.
* since `componentType:compTyp1` is child of the `structure` node and has no `initialValues` child node, the number of components to instantiate must come from the data source;
* since the `dataSource` node does not have a `componentId` property, only one component can be instantiated (there is no way to uniquely identify it in the spreadsheet). As a result, all data in _climat.ods_ will be used to instantiate a single instance of `componentType:compTyp1`;
* property `dim` tells ModelMaker that indices for the first table dimensions are to be read in column __lat__, and for the second dimension in column __long__;
* column headings prefixed with "__otherVar:__" indicate that these columns are sub-fields of the *otherVar* `table` (cf. graph);
* finally, the 96 (=12×8) different lines with different indices (CAUTION: the indices start at 0 for 3Worlds table data structures) will all go into the same constants table as specified by the *climate* `category` of the `componentType:compTyp1`, of which only one instance automatically identified as *#49* by *ModelRunner* has been created.

====== Example 2: using multiple _dataSource_ nodes

These `.ods` spreadsheets:

image::configuration-experimentIMG/example-spreadsheet-termites.png[align="center"]

with the following specifications: 

image::configuration-experimentIMG/example-termites2.png[align="center"]
image::configuration-experimentIMG/example-termites1.png[align="center"]

will result in the instantiation of _four_ system components with ids **77** to **80**, belonging to category **waterBody**, with an elaborate data structure as shown on the graph, containing a table *turbidity* of dimensions *3* with values read from the *termites.ods* file, sheets **ponds1** and **ponds2** (from debugger): 

[source,]
----
container:sys1[
  categories:[[category:*arena*], ...]
  local_items:{...}
  sub_containers:[
    container:pond[
      local_items:{
        77=[SystemComponent:77 (xx=36.0 yy=53.0 turbidity={[3],0.91,0.61,0.18} depth=-0.578 level=0.0)], 
        78=[SystemComponent:78 (xx=12.0 yy=27.0 turbidity={[3],0.21,0.74,0.0}  depth=-3.5   level=0.0)], 
        79=[SystemComponent:79 (xx=0.0  yy=0.0  turbidity={[3],0.0,0.37,0.14}  depth=0.0    level=0.0)], 
        80=[SystemComponent:80 (xx=24.0 yy=87.2 turbidity={[3],0.0,0.0,0.0}    depth=-1.02  level=0.0)]
      } 
    ]
    ...
  ]
]
----

How?

* property  `subclass` in `dataSource:pondData1` and `dataSource:pondData2` (not shown) tell *ModelMaker* that the file to be read is in `.odf` format.
* property `file` gives the name of the file to read, here **termites.ods**.
* property `sheet` in `dataSource:pondData1` and `dataSource:pondData2` tell *ModelMaker* that the data are contained in, respectively, sheets **ponds1** and **ponds2** of this file. 
* since `componentType:compTyp3` is child of a `groupType`, an `idGroup` property must be provided in the `dataSource` nodes to identify into which group container components instances will be stored; and an `idComponent` property to identify how many components must be instantiated;
* four different components identifiers **P1**, **P2**, **P3**, **P4** (columns **id** and **pid** according to `idComponent` properties of the two `dataSource` nodes) and only one group identifier **pond** (column **type** according to `idGroup` properties of the two `dataSource` nodes) are found in the data sources. They trigger the instantiation of one group container with four components;
* as `dataSource:pondData2` contains tabular data, a `dim` property tells which column contains the table indices (**d**);
* as `dataSource:pondData1` contains no data for component **P3** (instantiated with identifier **79**), its `xx`, `yy` and `depth` fields are empty (= 0.0);
* as `dataSource:pondData2` contains no data for component **P2** (instantiated with identifier **80**), for `turbidity[**2**]` in **P1** (instantiated with identifier **78**), and for `turbidity[**0**]` in **P3** (instantiated with identifier **79**), all these table celles are empty (= 0.0).

CAUTION: If two different data sources contain data for the same field / table cell in the same component, only the last value read will be kept. Since the order of `dataSource` nodes processing is unpredictable, this should be avoided. Take care!


====== Example 3: using a mixture of _dataSource_ and _initialValues_ nodes

This `.csv` text file:

image::configuration-experimentIMG/example-animal-csv.png[align="center"]

with the following specifications: 

image::configuration-experimentIMG/example-animal3.png[align="center"]
image::configuration-experimentIMG/example-animal2.png[align="center"]
image::configuration-experimentIMG/example-animal1.png[align="center"]

will result in the instantiation of: 

* _six_ system components with ids **50** to **55**, belonging to category **adult**, with their `age` automatic variable read from the `dataSource:animalData` node;
* _six_ group containers with ids **e_adult**, **e_offspring**, **e_young**, **r_adult**, **r_offspring** and **r_young**. Components **50** to **53** belong to group **e_adult** while components **54** to **55** belong to group **r_adult**
of life cycle **rat**. 
* _two_ life cycles with ids **elephant** (containing the three former groups) and **rat** (containing the three latter groups).
with the hierarchy of containers is described by all the `initialValues` nodes visible on the graph (from debugger):

How?

* property  `subclass` in `dataSource:animalData` tells *ModelMaker* that the file to be read is in `.csv` format.
* property `file` gives the name of the file to read, here **species.csv**.
* property `separator` in `dataSource:animalData` tells *ModelMaker* that the fields are separated with **";"**. 
* since `componentType` nodes in this graph are all children of a `groupType` node, themselves children of a `lifeCycleType` node, properties `idLifeCycle`, `idGroup` and `idComponent` are required in data files to properly identify the components to instantiate;
* six different components identifiers **robert**, **jasmine**, **pepe**, **groumpf**, **squick** and **squack** (column **id** according to the `idComponent` property of `dataSource:animalData`); two group identifiers **e_adult** and **r_adult** (column **stage** according to the `idGroup` property of `dataSource:animalData`); and two life cycle identifiers **elephant** and **rat** (column **species** according to the `idLifeCycle` property of `dataSource:animalData`); are found in the data source. They trigger the instantiation of two life cycle containers, each containing a single group container (from the data structure in the file), the former containing the first 4 components and the latter the last 2 components;
* four `initialValues` nodes are also defined in this graph. They are all children of `groupType` nodes, meaning that they apply to groups and not to components. Since the groups in this model do not declare any data, the `initialValues` nodes only tell *ModelRunner* to instantiate one container for each of them (`nInstances` property set to 1). Without these declarations, *ModelRunner* would not instantiate thee containers and would not know where to store instances of components of categories `young` and `offspring` (as no instance of these is required in the data source);
* as `dataSource:animalData` only contains data for the `age` automatic variable, all the instances of adult rats and elephants have their `birthDate` value set to 0; you can also verify that elephants have a much longer life span than rats.

CAUTION: if `dataSource` and `initialValues` nodes are used to instantiate the same components, groups, life cycles, or the arena, all `dataSource` nodes are processed first (in unpredictable order), followed by all `initialValues` nodes (in unpredictable order too).
