=== Basics - what you must know before starting

3Worlds is an application designed to develop and launch simulations of ecosystems. 
It is highly versatile and can simulate any kind of ecosystem using any kind of mathematical logic.
 
The application and use of 3Worlds to a particular ecosystem for a particular study case is called a _model_ -- or, more precisely a _simulation_ model.
The model must first be specified and developed (this involves writing some code in the java programming language) before it can be executed for a particular case study. 
This execution is called a _simulation experiment_.

3Worlds comprises two main applications: 

* `ModelMaker`, to configure a model;
* `ModelRunner`, to run the model.

Creating a model involves creating a configuration with `ModelMaker` and developing some associated Java code to specify details particular to your model.
To do this, you must use the https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse] programming software (freeware). Later versions of 3Worlds may support other packages, but at the time of writing, 3Worlds will only work with https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[eclipse].

`ModelMaker` will generate Java code for data structures specific to a model (based on the configuration file you have developed) and _template_ java code for each process you have defined. These process templates are where you enter programming code to implement your model. You only need to write  code for your processes and for model initialisation. All else is managed by 3Worlds.

3Worlds is written in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)[java], which makes it OS-independent. It can be run on MacOS, Linux or Windows computers.

=== Prerequisites
You will need the following software installed on your computer before installing 3Worlds:

* Java JDK (**J**ava **D**evelopment **K**it), version 11 or greater (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html[Oracle] or http://openjdk.java.net/[open] version)
* Java fx (graphical user interface library for java: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javafx-overview-2158620.html[Oracle] or http://openjdk.java.net/projects/openjfx/[open] version)
* an https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse] Java development environment and add the  https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html[e(fx)clipse plugin] required for Javafx

=== Running ModelMaker

This assumes you have downloaded `tw-**<os>**.jar` (where *<os>* stands for **linux**, *win* or **mac**, according to your operating system) from the last release on https://github.com/3worlds/3w[github/3w].

On your computer, in your home directory:

. Create a new directory and name it `3w`
+
WARNING: This is compulsory: 3worlds will **_not_** run if the directory does not exist, is named otherwise, or is located elsewhere than at the root of the user home directory. To know your user home directory, refer to your https://help.dugeo.com/m/faq/l/245652-where-is-my-user-home-directory[operating system].
. Copy or move `tw-**<os>**.jar` into `3w`
. For __linux users__: set the executable file permission of `tw-**<os>**.jar` to true (`chmod +x tw-**<os>**.jar` in a terminal, in the directory where the file is) so that it can be executed
. Double-click on `tw-**<os>**.jar`. This should launch the ModelMaker application
. If this doesn't work, open a terminal and type `java -jar tw-**<os>**.jar`. This should launch the ModelMaker application

It is preferable to run the software from a terminal window. This way, any errors that may arise will be displayed as text in the terminal
// I think we could supply a bash shell and a windows .bat file to handle this - Ian

NOTE: to develop your model-specific code, you will need to setup a Java development environment as shown in  <<truesetting-up-a-java-development-environment-for-the-user-code>>.

=== Setting up a Java development environment for the user code

==== Setting up the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for 3Worlds

This assumes you have downloaded `tw.jar`.

. If not yet done, install https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse] (don't forget https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html[e(fx)clipse]!)

. Create at _workspace_ (a working directory for Eclipse - Eclipse will ask for it when launched). e.g., _<my_workspace>_

. Within Eclipse, create a _project_:
* Select menu `File -> New -> Java project`; this opens a dialog box 
* In the dialog box, type a project name (e.g. _<my_project>_)
* Click the `Finish` button

. Import 3Worlds dependencies:
* Select menu `Project -> Properties`; this opens a dialog box 
* In the dialog box, select `Java Build Path`
* Select the `Libraries` tab
* Select `ClassPath`
* Click on the `Add external JARs...` button; this open a file selection dialog box
* In the file selection dialog box, browse and select `tw-**<os>**.jar`
* Click the `Apply and Close` button

// NB: UserCodeRunner is created when a 3w project is linked to a Java project - it is not 'imported' from anywhere
//. Import `UserCodeRunner.java` in the project:
//* Select menu `File -> Import`; this opens a dialog box 
//* In the dialog box, select `general > File System`
//* Click the `next` button
//* Click on the `Browse` button to select the directory where `UserCodeRunner.java` is located
//* Select the proper file in the list
//* Select `/src` as the destination location in the project
//* Click the `Finish` button
//`UserCodeRunner.java` should now appear as the unique member of a `default` package, with a compile error message attached to it.
 
//+ 
//`UserCodeRunner.java` should now have no compile errors.


==== Running ModelMaker from Eclipse

ModelMaker can be run from Eclipse or as a standalone application since it is included in the `tw-**<os>**.jar` library required to develop the user code.

* In the `package explorer` window, expand the `Referenced libraries` entry
* Right-click on the `tw-**<os>**.jar` entry, select `Run as -> Java Application`. This opens a dialog box
* In the dialog box, type _Main_
* In the list of matching items, select `Main - au.edu.anu.twuifx.MMmain` and click `OK` 
* If warning errors appear, click `Proceed`. This launches the ModelMaker application

==== Linking user code with model configuration

This requires the following actions:

. In ModelMaker,
* create or open a _3Worlds_ project (`Projects` entry of the main menu)
* select `Preferences -> Java Project -> Connect...`. This opens a dialog box with a file selector
* select the root directory of the _Eclipse_ project as created above (e.g. _<my_workspace>_/_<my_project>_) 

+
This operation tells `ModelMaker` to generate its code into the user java project.
When you want to edit your code in eclipse, you must first *refresh* the eclipse project:

. In Eclipse,
* select the project name at the very top of the `package explorer` window
* right-click on it and select `Refresh`
* or, alternatively: press the *F5* key

NOTE: You don't *have* to do this. We provide it as a facility if you want to run ModelMaker from eclipse rather than directly for some reason of your own.

==== Debugging and testing user code

The user code, first generated by `ModelMaker` and further edited by the user, can be run using `UserCodeRunner.java`. This class can be found in the `default` src directory and was created when linking this project with the 3Worlds project (cf above).
It requires three command line arguments (we assume that you know how to setup and run a `Run Configuration` in Eclipse):

* an instance number (more about this later); leave this at '0' for now.

* the name of the directory of the 3Worlds project as created by `ModelMaker` (e.g. _project_test_model9_2019-09-05-08-50-20-458_). This project directory is located under the `3w` directory automatically created by `ModelMaker` as its working directory
* some optional settings to switch on debugging logs.
 
With this, the user code should be executed as a test simulation by `UserCodeRunner`.

WARNING: Further edits and modifications of the configuration can be made in `ModelMaker`, but don't forget to keep the Eclipse project content synchronized with the ModelMaker project by refreshing the Eclipse project as often as necessary.
