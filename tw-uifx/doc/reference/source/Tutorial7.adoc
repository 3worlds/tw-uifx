=== Random number generators

==== Introduction

This tutorial introduces the use of random number generators (RNG). 
3Worlds provides for:

* A single default RNG

* Any number of independent RNGs;

* Three different RNG alogithms; and,

* Management for seeding the RNGs.

Two RNG algorithms are available in addition to the standard Java RNG: Pcg32 and XSRandom. Two important properties of RNGs are their quality (the degree to which they cannot be predicted better than by a random chance) and the computer resources required to produce them (memory and speed). Both Pcg32 and XSRandom are much faster (50% and 75% respectively) and of higher quality than the native Java RNG. Pcg32 is of higher quality than XSRandom (the default).

For the purpose of debugging and experimental design it is often necessary to manage the RNG seeds.
