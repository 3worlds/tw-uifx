A model of an ecological system in 3Worlds consists in a _configuration file_ constructed with the `ModelMaker` application (<<trueconfiguration-reference-creating-and-editing-a-model-with-modelmaker>>) and _java code files_ that must be edited by the end-user, here a modeller. Some basic knowledge of https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Introduction[java] is required before going on here.

==== Generated code: the __model main class__

During the specification of a model, ModelMaker generates java classes meant to be further edited in order to implement the specific behaviours imagined by the modeller. Among these classes, one is meant to be edited; the others are interface code, that you can see as 'glueing' code between the 3Worlds main code and the user-defined one. The file to be edited is named after the 3Worlds root node of the specification file (<<configuration-reference.adoc#truethe-3worlds-node>>): e.g., if your 3Worlds node has the name `myModel`, the java file to edit will be called `MyModel.java`. In what follows, we call it the __model main class__.

This section gives general rules to follow to successfully edit the generated _model main class_ in order for your model to behave as you wish. <<getting-started.adoc#truesetting-up-a-java-development-environment-for-the-user-code>> describes how to link your `ModelMaker` session with an eclipse development environment where you can edit the generated _model main class_. It is important to read about  <<configuration-ecosystem-dynamics#truefunction,functions>> before starting writing your code, in order to master all the options you can setup in `ModelMaker` to specify your function.

For each `function` node of the specification, you will find one static method with the same name in the _model main class_. For example, the **IDHClock** tutorial (<<tutorial4.adoc#truetutorial-4-elaborating-the-model-structure-testing-the-intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis>>) specifies 3 functions, 2 initFunctions and 2 data trackers (<<fig-idhClock-functions>>).

In this example, you can see that:

* the package name `code.sys1` is constructed from the name of the `system` node (<<fig-idhClock-functions>>);
* the interface name `IdhClock1` is constructed from the name of the `3Worlds` node (<<fig-idhClock-functions>>);
* each method name is constructed from a matching `function` or `initFunction` node (<<fig-idhClock-functions>>).
* the argument lists are partly constructed from the `categories` the `process` declaring the `function` applies to;
* the comments documenting the method arguments are constructed from the `field` or `table` node properties (`description`, `precision`, `interval`, `units`, etc.).
+
NOTE: Do not neglect these metadata: coding errors due to discrepancies in measurement units between equations are frequent and yield wrong computation results that are difficult to trace. Most publicly available model code does not document the units, and hence is not easily re-usable.

When ModelRunner is launched on the IDHClock tutorial model, it will include the generated `IdhClock1` class and call each of its methods for all system components they are dealing with as specified in the model configuration file.

As you can see in this example, the body of each method is empty, only containing two comments:

[source,java]
----
	// initComm ---- Code insert Begin-->
	// initComm ---- Code insert End----<
----
These are the __code insertion markers__. The user-defined code must be inserted between these two lines.

WARNING: Never remove the __code insertion markers__ as they are used by 3Worlds when using code <<configuration-ecosystem-dynamics.adoc#truefunction,snippets>> (as in all tutorial and test models).


As _model main class_ is a java __**interface**__, all data is passed as arguments to its static methods. As you can see in the example above, there may be many arguments. If you look closely, you will see that these arguments match the _descriptors_ that were attached to the _categories_ to which the _processes_ apply. All this information is provided in the _model main class_ as javadoc comments. For example, the javadoc comment of the `commGrowth` method above produces this output:

image::user-coding-referenceIMG/fig-javadoc-idhclock.png[align="center"]

This comment recalls the categories to which the `commGrowth` method applies, which timer it follows and which time units it uses, and any other useful information like precedence between methods as specified by `dependsOn` cross-links between processes.

Finally, the __model main class__ itself has a general javadoc description that gives some information about how to insert useful code into its methods:

image::user-coding-referenceIMG/fig-javadoc-idhclock2.png[align="center"]

==== __Model main class__ method arguments

The list of arguments of each method is defined by its <<configuration-ecosystem-dynamics.adoc#truefunction,function type>>, the organisation level to which it applies (system, life cycle, group or component), the categories or relation types it applies to, and the user-defined data structures attached to these. Some arguments are read-only, others are writeable so that computation output can be passed back to the 3Worlds main code.

===== Read-only arguments

====== Arguments present for all _functions_ and _initFunctions_

[horizontal]
`random`:: The <<configuration-dataDefinition.adoc#truerandom-number-channels,random number generator channel>> associated to this function. For details of how to use an instance of class `java.util.Random`, see the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html[javadoc] for this class. Most of the time, you will be calling `random.nextDouble()` which returns a random double value between 0.0 and 1.0.

====== Arguments present for all _functions_ but not for _initFunctions_

[horizontal]
`t`:: the _current time_ passed by the simulator as a double value in units of the `timer` of the parent `process` of the `function`.
`dt`:: the __current time step__, passed by the simulator as a double value in units of the `timer` of the parent `process` of the `function`. 

+
CAUTION: In the case of multiple timers, for `ClockTimers`, the current time step may be different from the timer's `dt` property because it is the time since last simulator iteration, which may have been triggered by a different timer.

====== Arguments present for all _'decision' functions_

'Decision' functions are: `ChangeCategoryDecision`, `DeleteDecision`, `CreateOtherDecision`, `RelateToDecision` and `MaintainRelationDecision`. They all return a result that is a decision: a number of components to create (`CreateOtherDecision`), the name of a category (`ChangeCategoryDecision`), or a boolean (all others).

[horizontal]
`decider`:: This argument of class `DecisionFunction` **[TODO: ref to javadoc]** is provided as a helper for transforming probabilities into decisions. This class comprises only one method `decide(...)` which given a probability, returns a `boolean`. More precisely: it returns `true` with the probability passed as argument, ie `decider.decide(0.7)` will return `true` in 7 calls out of 10. It uses the function random number generator (the `random` argument) to make the decision. Technically, this is the realisation of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution[Bernouilli distribution].
`selector`:: This argument is only present for the `ChangeCategoryDecision` function type. The `SelectionFunction` class **[TODO: ref to javadoc]**, of which it is an instance, only has one method `select(...)` which, given a list of weights __w__, returns an integer _i_ with probability __w__[__i__]/Σ__~i~____w__[__j__], i.e. a realisation of a single trial of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution[multinomial distribution].
`recruit`:: This argument is only present for the `ChangeCategoryDecision` function type. The `RecruitFunction` class **[TODO: ref to javadoc]**, of which it is an instance, has one method `transition(...)` which returns a category name (`String`), or `null` if the component does not change category. It's argument is either a `boolean` or an `int`, typically the result of a call to `selector.select(...)` or `decider.decide(...)`. Example of use:

+
[source%nowrap,java]
----
public static String recruitSeedling(
    double group_recruitRate,
    ...
    Random random,                        // random number generator
    DecisionFunction decider,             // decision function
    SelectionFunction selector,           // selection function
    RecruitFunction recruit) {            // recruitment function
    
    return recruit.transition(decider.decide(group_recruitRate));
}
----

====== Arguments that represent a component in function types which process applies to categories

These function types are `ChangeCategoryDecision`, `ChangeState`, `DeleteDecision`, `CreateOtherDecision`, and `SetInitialState`.

Internally, the system component which is the target of such functions is called _focal_.

The argument list will contain all the fields and tables declared in the root record of the descriptors (drivers, automatic variables, constants and decorators) of the _focal_ component. The argument comments will indicate that these arguments are descriptors of the _focal_ component, as in this example from the *IDHClock* tutorial for a function of type `SetInitialState`:

[source%nowrap,java]
----
public static void initComm(
    DoubleTable x,                        // focal component drivers population size dim = [40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    double div,                           // focal component decorators  ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DoubleTable K,                        // focal component constants carrying capacity dim = [40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DoubleTable alpha,                    // focal component constants interspecific competition coefficient dim = [40,40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DoubleTable r,                        // focal component constants growth rate dim = [40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    Random random) {                      // random number generator
    ...
}
----

====== Arguments that represent the two components of a relation in function types which process applies to relation types

These function types are `ChangeOtherState`, `ChangeRelationState`, `MaintainRelationDecision`, `RelateToDecision`, and `SetOtherInitialState`.

These functions apply to a pair of components linked by a relation. The first of these components (the one at the 'from' end of the relation) is called _focal_, as before. The second one (the one at the 'to' end of the relation) is called _other_.

To distinguish the descriptors of _other_ from those of _focal_ (since these might belong to the same categories and hence have the same descriptors), all the descriptors of _other_ are prefixed with 'other_', as in this example from the *IDHClock* tutorial for a function of `ChangeOtherState` type:

[source%nowrap,java]
----
public static void distEffectsComm(
    double t,                             // current time
    double dt,                            // current time step
    double freq,                          // focal component constants  ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    double inten,                         // focal component constants  ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DoubleTable other_x,                  // other component drivers population size dim = [40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    double other_div,                     // other component decorators  ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DoubleTable other_K,                  // other component constants carrying capacity dim = [40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DoubleTable other_alpha,              // other component constants interspecific competition coefficient dim = [40,40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DoubleTable other_r,                  // other component constants growth rate dim = [40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    Random random) {                      // random number generator    ...
}
----

====== Arguments that represent the local context of a component

The local context of a component is the part of the system it always sees. The dynamic graph of a simulated system in 3Worlds *always* has:

* an object representing the whole system,  called the _arena_ ('the place where things happen': https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10021-011-9466-2[Gignoux et al. 2011]). As 3Worlds uses a dynamic graph to represent the whole system (<<purpose.adoc#truethe-complex-system-as-a-dynamic-graph>>), this object actually represents the whole graph. It matches the <<configuration-reference.adoc#truethe-system-node,__system__>> node in the configuration graph of the `.ugt` file.

And it *may* (0..* multiplicity) have the following other kinds of nodes:

* objects representing the individual entities of the system, which are nodes in the dynamic graph and are just called <<configuration-ecosystem-structure.adoc#truesystem-components,__components__>>.
* objects that represent the common properties of a group of components, which are called <<configuration-ecosystem-structure.adoc#truecomponent-groups,__groups__>>.
* objects that represent the transitions that can occur during the life of a component, and are therefore called <<configuration-ecosystem-structure.adoc#true-life-cycle,__life cycles__>>.

These four types of objects may belong to _categories_ and have __descriptors__, and as a consequence can be passed to _functions_ of a _process_ referencing their categories.

With regard to processes and functions, these objects are treated like components, except they cannot establish __relations__; only true components can. This limits the set of functions compatible with them: groups, life cycles and the arena can only be affected by `ChangeState`,
`SetInitialState` and `CreateOtherDecision` (not life cycles) function types. When these functions apply to the categories of a `group`, `lifeCycle` or `Arena` object, they are treated as components above, i.e. they become the _focal_ 'component' of the user-defined methods.

The arena, groups and life cycles play a particular role in the dynamic graph, as indicated by their names. They also have implicit, 'ontological' relations with system components: a component always knows about its group, life cycle, and arena because they describe part of its own behaviour. As such, they are always accessible as arguments in the function calls of any component.

Just as for the _other_ component above, the descriptors of arena, life cycles and groups are prefixed when they appear in a method argument list, with a comment giving more information on the argument, as in this example from the *Palms* show-case model for a function of `CreateOtherDecision` type:

The code generator decides which arguments must be made available to a method based on this hierarchy: **arena > life cycle > group > component**. When the method applies to a component, then all four hierarchical levels are accessible; when it applies to a group, only arena and life cycle descriptors are available, and the group arguments are treated as the __focal__ 'component'.

====== Space data

When a space is attached to a <<configuration-ecosystem-dynamics.adoc#trueprocess,process>> through a `inSpace` cross-link, the following argument is added to the method list:

[horizontal]
`limits`:: The limits of the space used with this process. This is an immutable object of class `Box` *[TO DO: link to javadoc]*. It returns the coordinates of the lower and upper ends of the space in all its dimensions through the `limits.lowerBound(int i)` and `limits.upperBounds(int i)` methods, where `i` is the dimension index.

===== Writeable arguments and method return values

User-defined functions are meant to modify the state of the graph, which technically means induce changes in descriptor values and creation/deletion of graph elements, namely components and relations. This cannot be done with read-only arguments.

====== Method return values

<<truearguments-present-for-all-decision-functions,Decision functions>> all have return values that are interpreted as follows:

[width="100%",options="header",cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|function type | return type | return value
|`ChangeCategoryDecision`|`String`|`null` or a new `Category`
|`DeleteDecision`|`boolean`|`true` if _focal_ is to be deleted
|`CreateOtherDecision`|`double`|the number of new components to create; the decimal part is interpreted as a probability to create an extra component.
|`RelateToDecision`|`boolean`|`true` if _other_ is to be related to _focal_
|`MaintainRelationDecision`|`boolean`|`true` if the existing relation between _focal_ and _other_ is maintained
|===

They all have <<truearguments-present-for-all-decision-functions,read-only helper arguments>>. Example from the *IDHClock* tutorial for a `RelateToDecision` function:

[source%nowrap,java]
----
public static boolean distOccurrence(
    double t,                             // current time
    double dt,                            // current time step
    ...
    double freq,                          // focal component constants  ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    ...
    Random random,                        // random number generator
    DecisionFunction decider) {           // decision function
    // distOccurrence ---- Code insert Begin-->
    return decider.decide(1.0/freq);
    // distOccurrence ---- Code insert End----<
}

----


====== Method writeable arguments

Change/Set-State functions have the following writeable arguments as output:

[width="100%",options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|function type | writeable arguments
|`setInitialState`|_focal_ constants & drivers
.2+|`changeState`|_focal_ drivers & decorators
   |decorators of __arena__, _life cycle_ & _group_
|`setOtherInitialState` |_other_ drivers & constants
.2+|`ChangeOtherState` |_other_ drivers & decorators
   |decorators of __arena__, _life cycle_, _group_, _other life cycle_ & _other group_
.3+|`ChangeRelationState`| _focal_ drivers & decorators
   |_other_ drivers & decorators
   |decorators of __arena__, _life cycle_, _group_, _other life cycle_ & _other group_
|===

These arguments appear in the argument list as specific inner classes instances with self-explained names: `focalDrv`, `focalCnt`, `focalDec`, `groupDec`, `groupCnt`, `arenaDrv`, `otherGroupDrv`, etc... Each of these arguments will contain the same fields as the original data structure it comes from. Any value set in these arguments will be carried back to the component when the method returns. For example, this is the generated code from the *IDHClock* tutorial for a function of type `ChangeOtherState`:

[source%nowrap,java]
----
public static void distEffectsComm(
    double t,                             // current time
    double dt,                            // current time step
    int count,                            // whole system autoVar count (#) ϵ[0..*]
    int nAdded,                           // whole system autoVar nAdded (#) ϵ[0..*]
    int nRemoved,                         // whole system autoVar nRemoved (#) ϵ[0..*]
    double freq,                          // focal component constants  ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    double inten,                         // focal component constants  ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DoubleTable other_x,                  // other component drivers population size dim = [40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DistEffectsComm.OtherDrv otherDrv,    // next drivers for other component 
    double other_div,                     // other component decorators  ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DistEffectsComm.OtherDec otherDec,    // new decorators for other component 
    DoubleTable other_K,                  // other component constants carrying capacity dim = [40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DoubleTable other_alpha,              // other component constants interspecific competition coefficient dim = [40,40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    DoubleTable other_r,                  // other component constants growth rate dim = [40] ± 0.0 ϵ]-∞,+∞[
    Random random) {                      // random number generator
    ...
}
----

In this example, the writeable arguments are `otherDrv` and `otherDec`. Both of them are of ad-hoc inner classes defined in the generated sub-directory of the eclipse project for **IDHClock** (file `DistEffectsComm.java`):

[source%nowrap,java]
----
public class OtherDec {
    public double div;
}

public class OtherDrv {
    public DoubleTable x;
}
----

Here, to set the `div` field of the _other_ decorators to 3.2, simply write `otherDec.div=3.2;` in your method code. 

CAUTION: As you can see above, the writeable arguments are also present as read-only arguments.

You may also have noticed in the example above that the comment besides `otherDec` is `// *new* decorators for other component`, while that besides `otherDrv` is `// *next* drivers for other component`. What does this mean? Well, this is just a reminder that decorators and drivers are not handled in the same way by 3Worlds (cf. <<configuration-ecosystem-structure.adoc#truecategory,categories>>): 

* *Decorator values* are only valid within a time step and are immediately changed, which means that any method writing a decorator value will change it for all other methods called during the same time step. Hence the '**new**' adjective.

* *Driver values* are carried over to the next time step, and thus are subject to a synchronized modification. To keep all component states consistent, the read-only argument for drivers store the values that were set at the previous time step, i.e. they represent the _current_ state of all components. When a modification of their value is computed, it is stored in the proper writeable argument that will be copied into a separate driver state representing the _next_ state of the component. _This makes sure that all components within a time step are viewed by each other in the same, consistent state._ It is only after all methods on all components of the current time step have been called that 3Worlds will replace the _current_ driver state with the _next_ driver state. Hence the '**next**' adjective.

WARNING: Forgetting about the difference of treatment between _decorators_ and _drivers_ can be the source of *major* but difficult to detect computation errors. Always know what you do!
