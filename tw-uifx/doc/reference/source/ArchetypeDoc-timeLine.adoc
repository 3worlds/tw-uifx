_Properties for_ `timeLine`:

[horizontal]
`scale`:: This property specifies the type of time scale to use. The usual time units pose many problems, because years, months, weeks and days are not integer multiples of each other. The option is either to use a real calendar time scale – but this is not needed in most simulation studies – or to use approximations which enable year, months, weeks and days to be integer multiples of each other (e.g. an easy approximation is to assume 30-day months, but this means years must be only 360-day long). This property proposes a set of such simplified, compatible sets of units, denoted as time scales.

`shortestTimeUnit`:: The shortest time unit used in this model. Note that the time scale constraints the time units compatible with each other for this property.

`longestTimeUnit`:: The longest time unit used in this model. _cf._ `shortestTimeUnit` for valid values

`timeOrigin`:: The value of time at simulation start, either as a long (number of `shortestTimeUnit`) or as a date; 0 by default.
