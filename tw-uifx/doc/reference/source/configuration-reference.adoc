In this section, 

* node and edge labels are indicated in `*bold*`
* text in triangular brackets (`<>`) mean a user-defined value is expected; the text usually specifies what kind of value is expected (e.g. `<__name__>` for a name, `<__int__>` for an integer number, etc.). If the text is required, it will be [underline]##underlined##, otherwise it is optional
* a _multiplicity_ in curly braces {} tells how many times the item may appear in a configuration: 
[horizontal]
{1}:: exactly one item is required
{0..1}:: the item is optional, i.e. one or zero is required
{1..*}:: one to many items are required
{0..*}:: any number of items is possible
* levels in the tree hierarchy are indicated by slashes `/`.
* a column `:` separates a node label from its name.

==== The _3Worlds_ node

`/*3worlds*:<[underline]##__name__##>` {1}

This node is the root of any 3Worlds configuration file (<<fig-root-example>>). The name will appear in ``ModelMaker``'s main window title, in the *project directory name* and in the *configuration graph file*. The name is requested and set when creating a new project (`Projects>New` menu entry in `ModelMaker`).

_Properties for_ `3worlds`

[#fig-root-example]
.The base tree of any 3Worlds configuration
image::configuration-referenceIMG/example-root.png[align="center",role="thumb",float="right",width=400]

[horizontal]
`authors`:: The list of this project author names.
`contacts`:: The list of the author contacts (e.g. e-mail addresses), in the same order as the author names (1-1 match).
`precis`:: A short description of the model contained in this project.
`publication`:: A list of bibliographic references in relation with the project.
`built-by`:: The user name under which this project was constructed and saved, together with the date of saving. This property is automatically set by ModelMaker.
`version`:: A user-defined version identifier for this project.

All these properties appear in the about box of `ModelRunner` and are saved in the ODD file describing the model.

==== The _system_ node

`/3worlds/*system*:<[underline]##__name__##>` {1..*}

This node and its sub-tree contains all the ecological concepts used to define a simulation model: what entities are modelled, what biological processes apply to them, at what time step they should run. The name is used to differentiate models as a simulation experiment may involve more than one model.

A 3Worlds ecosystem is constructed as a population of 'biological entities', called _system components_, which establish interactions called _system relations_. Components and relations have _variables_ that may change value over time, according to various _ecological processes_ attached to components. In other words, an ecosystem is represented as a _dynamic graph_ which changes state and structure over time. To reflect this, `*system*` has two sub-trees called `*structure*` and `*dynamics*`.

For very simple models, where the modelled system is not further subdivided into components, the structure sub-tree is not required. In this case,the system node will be used as a unique 'component' describing the system (cf tutorial: <<TODO,logistic>>).

_Cross-links_ for `system`:

`belongsTo -> category:<__name__>` {1..*}::
This link tells to which categories the system node belongs. The categories must not belong to the same category set. If there are nested categories, membership is inherited.The categories targets of these links must be specific to the system, i.e. no `componentType`, `groupType` or `lifeCycleType` should refer (`belongTo` cross-link) to any of them.

`belongsTo -> category:*arena*` {1}::
This link to the predefined category `\*arena*` is required in all models (<<truethe-predefined-sub-tree>>). The arena is 'the place where things happen', i.e. it describes the part of the system where components interact. If no components are modelled, then it is the system.

`belongsTo -> category:*atomic*|\*assemblage*` {1}::
This link to either the predefined category `\*atomic*` or `\*assemblage*` is required in all models. Only if the system is very simple (no components, no groups, no life cycles) should `\*atomic*` be selected. It means the system has no further subdivision. In any other case (i.e. as long as there is a structure sub-tree), the system should be an `\*assemblage*`. Assemblages have three automatic variables: the system size (number of components) `count`, the number of new components added during last time step `nAdded`, and the number of components deleted during the last time step `nRemoved`.

`belongsTo -> category:*permanent*` {1}::
This link to the predefined category `\*permanent*` is required in all models. It specifies that the system is going to stay forever (permanent) during a simulation.

==== The _system/structure_ node

`/3worlds/system/*structure*:<[underline]##__name__##>` {0..1}

This node and its sub-tree contains the description of the system component and relation types. It is based on the concept of __category__. A category is a set of components with an identical description, e.g. the same set of state variables or the same growth function. 

include::configuration-ecosystem-structure.adoc[]

==== The _system/dynamics_ node

`/3worlds/system/*dynamics*:<[underline]##__name__##>` {1}

This node and its sub-tree contains the description of the processes that will change the state of the system and create its dynamics. It is based on the concepts of __time model__, __ecological process__, and __life cycle__. Internally, the `*dynamics*` node is the __simulator__, i.e. the object which, when kicked to do so, will make all the computations necessary to run a simulation.

include::configuration-ecosystem-dynamics.adoc[]

==== The _dataDefinition_ node 

`/3worlds/*dataDefinition*` {1}

This node and its sub-tree contains the detailed specifications of descriptors used in a model. This information is used by 3Worlds to generate java code for the data structures that will be used in simulations of this particular model. These data structures are then made available to descendants of 3Worlds  <<configuration-ecosystem-dynamics.adoc#truefunction,functions>> that users will edit and modify to describe their particular model.

include::configuration-dataDefinition.adoc[]

==== The _experiment_ node

`/3worlds/*experiment*:<[underline]##__name__##>` {1}

This node and its sub-tree describe the experimental design to run using a given _model_ and external data sets. Typically, il will tell `ModelRunner` how many simulations should be run, possibly varying some parameters of the model according to some plan, where data should be read and saved. The name is used to differentiate simulation experiments in a meaningful way. 

The default, simplest, simulation experiment is just to run a single simulation of the _baseline_ model.

include::configuration-experiment.adoc[]

==== The _userInterface_ node

`/3worlds/*userInterface*:<__name__>` {1}

This node and its sub-tree specifies the look of the `ModelRunner` user interface. `ModelRunner` is highly configurable and can show many graphs during a simulation run, as help when debugging a new model; or only show a progress bar to improve computing performance when running a big simulation experiment.

include::configuration-gui.adoc[]

==== The _predefined_ sub-tree

`/3worlds/**predefined:\*categories***` {1}

This sub-tree is not editable. It specifies predefined categories, relation types and automatic variables that are used in any 3Worlds model in assocation with particular objects in the simulator. During the setup of a configuration, ModelMaker will sometimes request you to link some of your nodes to items found in this hierarchy.

Predefined categories are grouped in 3 ``categorySet``s:

* `\*systemElements*` represent hierarchical levels in the system:
** `\*arena*` is a category attached to the whole system
** `\*component*` is a category attached to any system component
** `\*group*` is a category attached to any group of system components
** `\*life cycle*` is a category attached to any life cycle
** `\*relation*` is currently not in use

* `\*organisation*` represent levels of organisation in the system:
** `\*atomic*`, is a category attached to single, individable (hence __atomic__), components
** `\*assemblage*` is a category attached to populations of components. Members of this category have the following automatic variables:
*** `count`, the population size
*** `nAdded`, the number of components added to the population during the last simulation step
*** `nRemoved`, the number of components removed from the population during the last simulation step
** `\*atomic*` is a category attached to elementary (atomic) components that cannot be further divided

* `\*lifespan*` represent the lifespan of a component in the system:
** `\*permanent*`, is a category for components that stay forever
** `\*ephemeral*`, is a category for components that can be created or deleted during a simulation.Members of this category have the following automatic variables:
*** `age`, the age of the component
*** `birthDate`, the simulation time when this component was created.

There are two predefined relation types:

* `\*parentTo*: \*component* -> \*component*` may be used to relate a component to its offspring, i.e. it enables to track genealogic links between components (see the `CreateOtherDecision` <<configuration-ecosystem-dynamics.adoc#truefunction,function>>).
* `\*returnsTo*: \*component* -> \*component*` is not yet in use.
