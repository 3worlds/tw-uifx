=== Event driven systems: Using the Event Timer in a spatial model

==== Introduction

This tutorial introduces 2-dimensional space by converting Tutorial 5 to a spatial model.

==== Specifications

. Start _ModelMaker_ and create a new project from `Tutorials -> Event timer 1` and name it 'Tut6'.

===== Data definition

We must first specify x,y coordinates for 'items' - the modelled entity.

. Create a `record` as a child of `dataDefinition:dDef` and name it 'itemDrvs'.
. Add 2 fields to this record named 'x' and 'y' of type `Double`.

A message appears indicating this new record must be associated with a `category`. This is done in the next section.

===== Structure

In the *structure* sub-tree we specify the type of space to use and associate it, and the `category:itemCat`, with the _xy_ coordinates specified above. We can also set the initial values of the coordinates at start up time.

Associate the item drivers with the item category.

. Right-click on `category:itemCat` and create an edge to the _xy_ coordinates by selecting `New edge -> drivers -> record:itemDrvs`.

Create the space and set its properties.

[start = 2]

. Create a `space` node as a child of `structure:struc1` and select `ContinuousFlatSurface` as its type.

. Right-click on `space:space` and create a new edge to `coordinate -> field:x` and name it 'x1'.

. Repeat the above but select `coordinate -> field:y` and name it 'y1'.

. In the properties editor for `space:space1`, set `y1#rank` to 1 and `space1#precision` to 0.01.

Set the dimensions of the space to 1,000 by 1,000 meters.

[start = 6]

. Set the properties of `space1#x-limits` and `space1#y-limits` to 0 to 1000 inclusive.

. Add the optional property `units` to `space:space1` and set its value to 'm' (meters). This is just for documentation.

Create a function to set initial values (the _xy_ coordinates) for the 100 items (a property of `component:item`) at start up.

[start = 8]

. Create an `initFunction` as a child of `componentType:itemType` and name it 'ItemInit'.

===== Dynamics

When new items are created by `process:Nitems` we need a function to set _xy_ coordinates of the newly created 'items'. This is a 'consequence' function. Consequence functions are children of other functions rather than a process.

. Create a `function` as a child of `function:Nitems`, name it 'MakeItem' and select `setOtherInitialState` as its type.

===== Coding

We now add some Java code to set values for the _xy_ coordinates. We will just set random values for the state up items and set values in newly created items to be clumped near their parent item.

. Add the following code to the `ItemInit#functionSnippet` property:

[source,Java]
-----------------
        // place dots in random locations (assuming these are the dimensions of the map)
        focalDrv.x = random.nextDouble() * 1000;
        focalDrv.y = random.nextDouble() * 1000;
-----------------

[start = 2]
. Add the following code to the `MakeItem#functionSnippet` property:

[source,Java]
-----------------
       // place dot randomly near 'parent' dot.
       double distance = -50.0 * Math.log(1 - random.nextDouble());
       double direction = random.nextDouble() * (2 * Math.PI);
       otherDrv.x = x + distance * Math.cos(direction);
       otherDrv.y = y + distance * Math.sin(direction);
-----------------

===== User Interface

Add a widget to view the items in space.

. Create a `widget` as a child to `tab:tab`, name it 'Item landscape' and select `SpaceWidget1` as its type.

. Add a `trackSpace` edge from `widget:Item landscape` to `space:space` (`trackSpace -> space:space1`).

Arrange the two widget horizontally (the default) - time series first.

[start = 3]

. Click on `widget:Item landscape` and in the _Selected properties_ editor, set `Item landscape#order` to 1.
