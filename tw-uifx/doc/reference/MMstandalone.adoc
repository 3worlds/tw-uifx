=== Running ModelMaker standalone

This assumes you have downloaded `3w.zip`.

. Unzip `3w.zip` in your user home directory (important), keeping the internal directory tree. This will extract a file `modelMaker.jar` and a `.3w` directory containing more jar files.
. Double-click on `modelMaker.jar`. This should launch the ModelMaker application.
. If this does not work, open a terminal and type `java -jar modelMaker.jar`. This should launch the ModelMaker application.

The last is the preferred method as any errors that may arise will appear in the terminal window.

*Note*: to develop your model-specific code, you will need to setup a java development environment as shown in section <<truesetting-up-a-java-development-environment-for-the-user-code,Setting up Java>>.
