=== Basics - what you must know before starting
3Worlds is an application designed to develop and launch simulations of ecosystems. 
It is highly versatile and can simulate any kind of ecosystem using any kind of mathematical logic.
 
The application and use of 3Worlds to a particular ecosystem for a particular study case is called a _model_ -- or, more precisely a _simulation_ model.
The model must first be specified and developed (this involves writing some code in the java programming language) before it can be executed for a particular case study. 
This execution is called a _simulation experiment_.

3Worlds comprises two main applications: 

* `ModelMaker`, to configure a model;
* `ModelRunner`, to run the model.

Creating a model involves creating a configuration with `ModelMaker` and developing some associated java code to specify details particular to your model.
To do this, you must use the https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[eclipse] programming software (freeware). Later versions of 3Worlds may support other packages, but at the time of writing, 3Worlds will only work with https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[eclipse].

`ModelMaker` will generate java code for data structures specific to a model (based on the configuration file you have developed) and _template_ java code for each process you have defined. These process templates are where you enter programming code to implement your model. You only need to write  code for your processes and for model initialisation. All else is managed by 3Worlds.

3Worlds is written in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)[java], which makes it OS-independent. It can be run on MacOS, Linux or Windows computers.
