=== Tutorial 1: Construct and run a model for the first time

In this tutorial we introduce _ModelMaker_ by implementing a simple logistic function as a simulation. As a way of looking at the behaviour of a simple equation, this is quite elaborate approach but our aim is to focus on the use of _ModelMaker_ without the distraction of a complex model.

In _3Worlds_, a simulation model is defined by constructing a graph of nodes and edges and setting their property values. The nodes represent elements of interest in the model and the edges represent the relationships between them. The graph constitutes the model specifications and once complete, can be run. As you assemble the graph, _ModelMaker_ is constantly checking and providing feedback on how these specifications comply with an archetype -  _3Worlds Archetype_. _ModelMaker_ guides you through this process by managing the available options at each stage in the graph assembly and providing an updated list of tasks requiring attention for the specifications to be compliant with the archetype. The over-arching purpose of this approach is that because any two models developed in this way are guarenteed to comply with the archetype, model comparison studies can proceed on much firmer ground as the differences between them are more apparent when specifications are compared. In short, arbitrary models need no longer have arbitrary designs.

The graph is both a tree and a directed graph. Each node has a parent (apart from the root node) and nodes can have additional edges from one node to another to indicate relationships between nodes. These we refer to as cross-links. Once the task list is complete, the simulation is ready to run.

If you haven't yet read any other_3Worlds_ documentation, reading "About ModelMaker" from the main menu `Help->About` will provide some preliminary context.

==== Creating a model configuration

. Start `ModelMaker`.
. Create a new project (`Main menu: Projects->New->Templates->Blank`)
. When prompted enter `Tut1` (must begin with uppercase). A single node called  `3Worlds:Tut1` now appears centred in the _graph_ window.

This node will be the root of a graph that defines the model. All nodes are identified by a _label:name_ pair. The _label_ is the type of node, representing its role, while the _name_ is the unique identifier for a node of the given type. A few node types, of which the root node is one, must have names beginning with an uppercase letter. These nodes are used to generate Java classes when the simulation compiles.

At this stage you can experiment with a few basic edit operations:

. Move a node around the graph display by dragging it with the left mouse button;

. Zoom in and out in the graph display window using the mouse wheel while holding down the `ctrl` key (or equivalent on your operating system). The focus of the zoom is provided by the mouse position;

. Change the node and text size with the controls at the bottom of the display; and,

. See available edit options for this particular node by right-clicking on it to display a local popup menu.

A list of tasks remaining to be completed appears at the bottom-left of the main window. This list grows and shrinks as the developing graph is checked against the _3Worlds archetype_.  A check takes place in the background every time the graph structure or its properties change. 

At the top-left of the main window are the two property editors - _Properties_ and _Selected Properties_.  These show properties for the entire graph and for a single selected node (mouse left-click) respectively. It is here that values are entered for the properties of nodes and edges created in the following steps. At this stage, there are five properties under the section `Tut1`.  These are properties of the root node (`3worlds:Tut1`) intended provide a minimal amount of documentation for this project. By default, the property `build-by` is filled out with your computer login name and this project's creation date.

At the bottom of the graph display are a number of controls that will be explained below. Float the mouse over these controls to see a hint as to their purpose.

All projects are located within the 3Worlds root directory called `.3w`. The dot indicates it’s a hidden directory (*WHY*). To see these files you may need to do what ever is required by your operating system to show hidden files. 

Within `.3w` there is now a sub-directory called something like `project_Tut1_2020-06-07-01-47-44-708`. Every project directory begins with the key word `project` followed by the name of the project you entered (`Tut1` in this case) and the the creation date and time. The purpose of naming project directories in this way is to make it almost impossible to overwrite a project inadvertently. 

Inside this directory are a number of text files:

. `Tut1.utg` is the model configuration graph we are constructing;
. `layout.utg` contains information used to display the graph;
. `MM.xml` contains the session's preference settings.
. `__StateA1` and sequences of similarly named files are temporary files to support the program's undo/redo editing operations. These files are created during a session and deleted when the session ends.  

All these files are text files and you can open them with a simple text editor. However, _you should never need to edit them and it is likely to lead to *problems* for your project if you do_. You can safely delete project directories at any time if you wish. If a project directory is deleted for the currently open session, all will be recreated automatically apart from the rollback data.

Returning to `ModelMaker`, you will see the project name is displayed in the window title along with the creation date. The task list currently shows four nodes are required. This list can be dealt with in any order but for now we will first add a `system` node. The `system` node forms the root of a sub-tree that defines the structure and dynamics of the modelled system. Other sub-trees deal with topics such as designing the user interface, the simulation experiment and the definition of data types used to generate the software for the simulation model. 

[start=4]
. *System*: Right-click on the `3worlds:Tut1` node (the root node) and select `new -> system` from the popup menu. You are then prompted for a name for this node. The default name is `sys1`. Accept this and click `ok`. The mouse pointer immediately becomes a cross-hair: `ModelMaker` is asking where you want to place this node. Move to some place within the graph display and left-click the mouse. The `system:sys1` node appears (teal coloured) connected by a green line to the root node (black). Green lines indicate a parent-child relationship between nodes. These lines are thicker at the child end of the line indicating `system:sys1` is a child of `3worlds:Tut1`.

+
All nodes in the configuration graph are children of some parent except, of course, the root node. You can only create nodes by right-clicking on a parent and making a selection from of possible child nodes from the popup menu. The items in this menu vary according to the possibilities allowed by the 3Worlds archetype. This is one way `ModelMaker` ensures that the developing configuration conforms with the archetype and greatly simplifies an otherwise very complex situation.
 
+
The specifications allow more than one `system` node.

. Right-click the root node and create a second `system` as above. The prompt will add an incremented number to the name to make sure the _label:name_ pair remains unique with in the graph. You can name a node anything you want (it must be alpha-numeric) but the prompt won't allow duplicate names.

. We won’t use this second `system` node so either right-click on it and select `Delete node` or undo the last operation: `Edit->Undo 'new node [system.sys2]'`.

The addition of the `system` node has added three more tasks to the task list. Two of these tasks are asking for edges to be added from the `system:sys1` node. However, its not apparent where these nodes are at this stage. 

Even though we started this project from a "Blank" template, a sub-tree has already been added and hidden from view when the project was created. To view this sub-tree, right-click on root node and select `expand -> predefined:*categories*`.

This sub-tree (all gray nodes) cannot be edited except for adding edges to or from nodes outside the tree. It's present in all models but can be largely ignored for this tutorial except that we must first connect the new system node to parts of it. The meaning of these connections will be more apparent when developing more complex models later. See the (*REF* for more details).

The first task asks that we create an edge from the system node to something called the `*Arena*` (`1. [Edge] Add edge [belongsTo:] from 'system:sys1' to [category:*arena*]`).

. Right-click on `system:sys1` and select `New edge -> belongsTo -> category:*arena*` and accept the default name for this edge.  A red cross-link line then appears between these two nodes with the line thicker at the end node. All cross-link lines are red and all parent-child lines are green. You can show or hide these types of lines using the `X` or `<` toggle buttons at the bottom of the graph display.

The task list has now updated. The task just completed has gone and an new message indicating that the configuration is unsaved has appeared. Press `ctrl-S` to save.

. Repeat the above steps for the next task `1. [Edge] Add edge [belongsTo:] from 'system:sys1' to [category:*permanent*]`.

The next task is essentially the same thing but expressed slightly differently. Its asking that we connect an edge from the system node to either a node named *individual* or *population*. 

. Repeat the above steps and select `New edge->belongsTo->category:*individual*`.


We've now finished with the `predefined` sub-tree and can hide it again to simplify the display.

. Right-click the root node and select `Collapse->predefined:*categories*. 

We now continue with the task associated with the system node. This is to create the `dynamics` sub-tree. In this simple model, We don't need to create a `structure` sub-tree. The need for that has been dealt with by the connections we just made to the `predefined` sub-tree. 

. *Dynamics*: In this sub-tree we create, in order, nodes called `timeLine`,`timer`, `process`, `function` and `dataTracker`. To avoid confusion in what follows, accept the default names unless otherwise noted.

. Create a `dynamics` node as a child of `system:sys1`. All nodes that are children of `dynamics` are coloured lime green.

. From the dynamics node create a `timeline` node. The timeline defines the time scale type for the simulation. In the properties editor, the drop down list for the 'tmln1#scale` property shows ten differnt types are available: all of them exact subdivisions of time except for the Gregorian scale type which implements the standard Gregorian calendar. The default is `ARBITRARY` which is fine for this tutorial.

. Create a 'timer' node (child of timeline). Here an extra prompt appears asking for the class of the timer: {`ClockTimer`, `EventTime`r, `ScenarioTimer`}. Select `ClockTimer`. This class increments time by a constant step during simulation, unless the timeline uses a Gregorian scale in which case irregularites such as leap years are managed. There is now a new type of task indicating a property value for the new timer is incorrect :`5. [Property] ['[Property:dt=0]' does not satisfy '[Property 'dt=0' must be within [1.0; 9.223372036854776E18].]']`. This just means the value of `dt` must be >= 1.

. In the property editor, change both `tmr1#dt` and `tmr1#nTimeUnits` to 1. `dt` is the time unit size and `nTimeUnits` is the number of time units per simulation step. There are 22 time unit types avaiable from microseconds to millennia. The current default value of `UNSPECIFIED` is fine for this tutorial.

. Create a process node as child of `timer:tmr1`. A process is a set of computions acting on model entities. These entities are defined in either the `predefined` or `stucture` sub-tree (the latter not being needed). Processes can be composed of any number of functions of ten different types. We need just one function to implement the logistic equation.

. Create a function node as a child of `process:p1`. Name it "Chaos" as this logistic equation can have interesting chaotic behaviour. After naming the function, a prompt appears for the funtion type. Select the first option `ChangeState`. The function type can't be changedafter the node is created. If you've made a mistake, delete the node (or "undo") and recreate it. The name of a function node must start with an uppercase letter. Functions directly translate into Java classes which, by convention, begin with an uppercase letter.

The equation we're going to implement is x(t+1) = rx(t)(1-x(t). To view the value of x we use a dataTracker connected to `process:p1`. 

. Create a `dataTracker` node as a child of `process:p1`. _x is a scalar number so when prompted for the dataTracker type, select `dataTrackerD0` (zero dimensions).

_ModelMaker_ interfaces with Integrated Development Environments (IDE) such as _Eclipse_  to write code for these functions. In this tutorial however, the situation is simple enough that we can just associate a code snippet with the function without the need to link to an IDE. The snippet will be inserted in the function when the simulation is compiled.

. Create a `snippet` node as a child of `function:Chaos`. In the property editor, locate the `snpt1#javaCode` property, click the edit button (`...`) and enter the following text:
`focalDrv.x = r*x*(1-x);`

Before creating the entity for the function to operate on, we should define the model's data: in this case it is simply r and x.

. Select the root node of the graph and create a `dataDefinition` node.

. Create `record` node as a child of `dataDefinition:dDef` and name it `par`.

. Create a `field` node as child of `record:par` and name it `r` and select its type as `Double`.

. Create another `record` as child of `dataDefinition:dDef` and name it `var`.

. Create a `field` node as child of `record:var` and name it `x` and select the type `Double`.

We can now connect the dataTracker to this field.

. From the `dataTracker` node, create an edge `trackField -> field:x`.

This is all the data we need to define. We can now deal with some of the simpler tasks before finishing off with the `structure` sub-tree of the `system`. These are the experimental design and the user interface.

. From the root node create an `experiment` node.

. From the `experiment:expt` node create a `design` node and choose `Type` when prompted. The default type is `SingleRun`.


For the user interface of the simulation model, we need some control to start/stop and pause simulations (a controller) and a time series chart of `x`. These nodes are collectivily called `widgets`. The user interface is organised into a toolbar at the top, a status bar at the bottom and any number of tabs containing widgets. We'll put the controller in the toobar and the time series chart in a tab.

. Create a `userInterface` node from the root node.

. Create a `top` noder from the `userInterface:gui` node.

. Create a 'tab' node from the  `userInterface:gui` node.

. Create a `widget` node from the `top:top` node, name it `ctrl` and select `SimpleControlWidget` from the drop-down list.

. Create a 'widget' node from the 'tab:tab1` node, name it `srsx` and select `SimpleTimeSeriesWidget` from the drop-down list.

. Create a `trackSeries` edge from `widget:srsx` to `dataTracker:trk1`. This connects the srsx widget to the `x` variable through the intervening data tracker. Data trackers work in an analogous way to real data trackers in the field. They track some environmental variable and can produce some statistical treatment of the raw data. 

You can tidy up the graph by pressing the `L` button at the bottom of the graph display.

Finally we need to build the `structure` sub-tree. 

. Do task number 3 in the task list: `3. [Node] Add node [structure:] to 'system:sys1'.` to create the root of the structure sub-tree.























However, we will ignore this for now and focus on creating the required nodes from the root. The `system` node and its sub-trees contain all concepts defined in your model. For more information on this and other node types, see the <<truereference-of-3worlds-configuration,reference>> section. 

[start=7]
. *Data definition*: Right click on the root node and select `new -> dataDefinition`, accept the default name and place it somewhere in the graph window. While there can be many `system` nodes in a configuration there can be only node of `dataDefinition` type. Hence the prompted name does not end with a number. Note also that this new node is a differnet colour. All nodes in the `dataDefinition` category are a pale red colour. 

+
Note the change in the task list. Adding `dataDefinition` did not add any more tasks to the list (but removed one – this task). The `dataDefinition` node will become the parent of all data types (records, fields and tables and their dimensions) that supply the necessary information for `ModelMaker` to make the required Java files.

. *Experiment*: Right click again on the graph root and select `new -> experiment` and proceed as before. All nodes in the `experiment` category (children of `experiment`) will be the same (gold) colour. This section of the configuration determines how the model is to run. This could be anything from a simple single run to a factorial experiment or may reference a file that contains other experimental designs.

. *User interface*: Again, right-click on the root node and create a new `userInterface` node. In this category we can design the user interface and choose the _widgets_ necessary to control the model and display results. _Widgets_ are autonomous components of a user interface that can be freely assembled to customize the user interface as required.

We now have a minimum set of children of the configuration root. You can delete, recreate or rename any of these nodes at any time, with the exception of the root node. After these edits, the main window title has a star added (unsaved). Press `ctrl-S` to save (or select `Projects -> Save`). Use `Save as...` if you want to save the project under a new name.

[start=10]
. *Cross-links*: Many nodes require information from nodes other than their children or parents. In the task list is a requirement to add an edge from experiment to system (`[Edge] Add edge [baseLine:] from 'experiment:expt' to [system:].`). To create this, right click on `experiment:expt` and select `New edge -> baseline - > system:sys1`. A red  line will appear with the name `bsln` between these two nodes. All cross-linked lines are red with the thick end of the line indicating the end node. In this case, the link can be read as "experiment:expt is the baseline for system:sys1" - *WHY I DON'T KNOW*

====
At the bottom of the graph display is a set of controls:

. The `L` button re-applies the current graph layout algorithm. The default layout function (`OrderedTree`) displays children from top to bottom in alphabetical order. The layout will not be applied to any nodes not connected to the graph root (nodes that have become isolated during editing). You can choose differnt layout methods from a node's local menu. There are 5 layout algoritms - three are specific to graphs with a single tree root and two a two are general "Spring" based layouts that make no assumption about tree structures. If a tree algorithm is chosen, the selected node becomes the root of the tree in the display. This does not change the underlying tree structure of the configuration file. 

. The `X` shows/hides the cross-link lines. As the graph becomes more crowded, you may want to hide these for clarity. 

. The `<` shows/hides the parent/child lines. Usually you want these displayed.

. The `>|` button will move any nodes isolated by either of the above two toggles to one side of the graph display.

You can zoom the graph display in and out by holding down the `ctrl` key while turning the mouse wheel. If the graph is larger than the display, you can drag it around using the mouse (left button down). Having readjusted the graph position or magnification, you can change the font or node size to suit. Whenever the layout is re-applied, there will be a small change in the horizontal position of nodes. This is just a random jiggle added to prevent vertical lines from being one on top of the other. 

. The Jitter button adds a small random displayment to the layed out nodes to help show overlapped lines and text. If this is >0, the nodes will move slightly (% of the graph display dimensions) everytime the layout operation is re-applied.

. When the mouse floats over a node, the node becomes highlighted (red). When highlighted, you can drag the node anywhere with in the display.

. If you left-click on a highlighted node, its properties will be displayed in the _Selected Properties_ tab (SPT) on the top-left of the main window. This display will show not only editable properties (if any) but any other non-editable properties there may be. 
All these control settings are automatically recorded in the project preferences file (`MM.dsl`) so when you reopen this project, its appearance will be as you left it. 
====

We will now proceed to develop the configuration by addressing all the tasks in the task list, until we have a minimal valid graph. 

[start=11]
. *Experiment design*:  Right-click on `experiment:expt` and add a new design node. In addition to the name, you will be prompted for a choice between a predefined experiment type and a file name. Choose `type`. Left-click on the new design node and look at its properties in the property editor (top-left).  The `type` property is shown there with its default value of  `singleRun`. The drop down list for this property shows that `crossFactorial` is also an option. 

[start=12]
. *Experiment time period*: Use the experiment node to add a `timePeriod` node to the graph. Once done there will appear a request to add an edge from this node to `ecology:/engine:` in the task list. However, we don’t have such a node at this time so we should move over to the `ecology` node. *SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE QUERIES HERE:*

NOTE: verbose1: [Node] system:sys1 start -1, end 1, length 1
verbose2: [Node] [NODE_QUERY_UNSATISFIED] [system:sys1=[↑3worlds:Tut1 ←experiment:expt] parameterClass=] start -1, end 1, length 1
[Specification: [mustSatisfyQuery:exclusiveCategoryCheckForSystemSpec ↑hasNode:systemSpec className=au.edu.anu.twcore.archetype.tw.ExclusiveCategoryQuery]].


. *Ecology engine*: Create an `engine` from the `ecology` node. This is the simulator that will manage executing processes at the appropriate time. 

. *Engine time line*: Select `engine` and create a new `timeLine`. The only requirement of an engine is that is has a _time line_ to define the type of _time scale_ within which the processes can be coordinated by various _time models_. Once this has been done, a bunch of new tasks appear. The default time scale type is `MONO_UNIT` and we need to select a particular unit. The task list indicates it can be anything from Microsecond to Millennium. For now, we will just choose `YEAR` for both the shortest and longest time unit. 

+
[#fig-screenshot-8]
image::tutorial1-shot8.png[align="center"]

. In the AEP, select `ecology:ecology1` category. Set the properties for longest and shortest time unit to `YEAR`. In fact, for the `MONO_UNIT` time scale, the longest and shortest units must be the same. There are many choices of time scale but they basically fall into two classes: those containing _regular_ subdivisions of time or a _Gregorian_ time scale (the usual occidental calendar), where months and years can vary in their number of days.

. *Cross-link from timePeriod to engine*: We can now create the link between these to nodes. You can only create 
a cross-link in `ModelMaker` starting with the `From` node. Right-click on `timePeriod:timePeriod1` and select 
`connect to - > periodFor - > engine:engine1`. This allows the engine to know the start and end times of the 
experiment. There are many other ways that an experiment can end and we will discuss this later. Next we need a 
process that will be executed when the model runs.

. *Ecological process*: Select the `ecology` node and create a new `process`. On this occasion we will give it the name `step`. Next we need a _time model_ to manage the `step` process.

. *Time model*: Select the `timeLine` node and create a new `timeModel`. Name it `step` as well and select `ClockTimeModel` as the model type. Save your work.

. *Property errors and other tasks*: the Task list has grown somewhat so now we will attend to a few simple things. The new time model has some invalid values. Set `dt` (the time step) to 1 (year), `nTimeUnits` to 1 (year – there can be any number of years in a step) and the `timeUnit` to  `YEAR` so it accords with the `timeLine`. The `timeLine` has a _grain_ size (could be any factor number of years); set it to 1. You can also add an edge from `process:step` to `timeModel:step` (`Connect to -> drivenBy -> timeModel:step`)

. In the AEP click on the category button next to the Search field. You’ll now see two categories of properties:
`ecology:ecology1` and `experiment:experiment1`. Click the arrow on the `experiment` category and it will expand
to show all properties of nodes in this category. Click on the edit button next to the 
`timePeriod:timePeriod1#end` property. A small dialog opens to set the end time for the experiment. Set a value of 100. 
The `y` is an abbreviation for `YEARS` which is what we have chosen in the `timeLine`.

. The `ecology` and `codeSource` trees are usually the most complicated to build. So before working on them, we will finish with the user interface. 

. To hide parts of the graph that we’re not working on (sub-trees) you can select a node and collapse all 
children of that node. Select `experiment:experiment1`, right-click and select `collapse`. You will notice that
the properties of experiment and its children have been removed from the AEP. Do the same with the 
`ecology:ecology1` node.

. *Tool bar*: right-click on `userInterface:userInterface1` and create a `ToolBarTop`.

. *Control widget*: right-click on `ToolBarTop:ToolBarTop1` and create a new widget call `controller`. Select 
`SimpleSimCtrlWidget` from the drop down list when prompted. 

. Select the `ToolBarTop:ToolBarTop1` node again and make a widget called `timer`. 
Select `timeDisplayWidgetfx` this time.

. When you run this model, widgets can appear in any arbitrary order in their containers (in this case the
 `ToolBarTop`). To prevent this and ensure the UI will have a consistent appearance, edit the `order` properties in
  the `userInterface` category for these two widgets. Make the controller 0 (the default) and the timer 1. 

. Both these widgets require a cross-link to the ecology engine. Select each widget in turn and connect them 
to the `ecology:engine1`.

+
[#fig-screenshot-9]
image::tutorial1-shot9.png[align="center"]

. Collapse the `userInterface` and `experiment` nodes, expand the `ecology` node and hide the `X` links. Tidy up the graph by reapplying the layout (L). Save your work.

We will create a minimal model in this first tutorial: a model with one process, one time model, one parameter and one state variable. The specifications provide for considerable complexity in defining multiple ecosystems, species and the various life stages they may move through. We will leave all that for another tutorial so we can focus in the procedures of model construction and deployment. However, in codeSource, we can’t avoid defining some data structures and therefore we now need some initial idea of a model. We will implement the simplest of chaos equations, the http://www.bendov.info/cours/chaos/logistic.htm[discrete-time logistic growth model]: 

_x~t+1~ = k.x~t~(1-x~t~)_

We have one parameter _k_ and one state variable _x_ that requires an initial state _x~0~ > 0_.

[start=29]
. From the `codeSource` node create a `record` named `pars` and a second `record` called `vars`. You must create a _record_ before you can make data fields. _Fields_ cannot exist outside a record definition, even, as in this case, the record contains only one field. Records can also contain _tables_ and tables can contain records _ad infinitum_.

. From `pars` create a field called `k`.

. From `vars` a field called `x`. Both will be of type `Double` by default (‘double precision’ floating point numbers). 

. From the `ecology` node, create a `partition`. Accept the default name. From `partition` create a `category` node. Again accept the default name. The use of _partitions_ and _categories_ is a simple way of defining complex relationships between data and processes. This will become clearer in later tutorials. For now, we just need one of each.

. We now define what constitutes a _driver_ (a state variable) and what is a _parameter_ for this `category`. Right-click on the category node and select `connect to - > drivers → record:vars`.

. To define the _parameters_ repeat the above but select `connect to - > parameters → record:pars`.

. Show the cross-links (`X`) and examine the edge names to be sure you haven’t selected the wrong option. If you have, just right-click on the `category` node and select `disconnect from...` to undo the error. 

. Assign the `category` to the `process`: Returning to the task list there is a requirement to connect the 
`process:step` to a `category` (or `relation`). Right click on the `process` node and select 
`connect to - > appliesTo - > category:category1`.

. Define a process _function_: The task list requires a child node of `process:step` of either 
`function` or `dataTracker`. _DataTrackers_ are a means of sending data from a `process` to a `widget` in the 
user interface or to file. They are like a virtual data logger used in field studies. They can perform quite 
complex operations just as can real data loggers. We will come to that later but for now we need to define a 
function that is run by this `process`. Right-click on `process:step` and create a new `function`. Call it 
`step` like its parent. When asked if you want a `userClassName` property, answer `no`. This is important. If 
you made a mistake, delete the node and repeat this step.

. Define the `function` _class_: There are many types of functions available in 3Worlds. We will use the 
`changeState` function. There is now a requirement in the task list that says `function:step` must have either 
a property `className` or an edge to a `functionSpec`. Having said `no` above to including a `userClassName` property, 
we now need to define a function specification. Function specifications are created in the `codeSource` category. 
Right-click on the `codeSource` node and create a new `functionSpec`, again called `step`. In the AEP you can 
see (under the `codeSource:codeSource1` category) that the function type is `ChangeState` - the default. To make 
the link between the `function:step` and the `functionSpec:step`, right click on `function:step` and select 
`connect to - > specifiedBy - > functionSpec:step`.

+
[#fig-screenshot-10]
image::tutorial1-shot10.png[align="center"]

. There are now just two tasks remaining in the task list: we need a _system_ and an _initial state_. Complete 
those two tasks by creating the required child nodes to `ecology:ecology1`.

. Collapse the `codeSource` node, hide the `X` links and reapply the layout.

. *System*:  A `system` is the thing being simulated. In our case it’s just the current and next value of `x`. The last task then, is to connect this `system` to a `category` where the system structure is defined. Complete this last task now.

.  *The configuration is now valid!* The red light next to the `check` button at the bottom left of the main window is now green and the model is ready to run.

==== Running a model

[start=43]
. Save your work (only a saved configuration can be run) and click the `Create and run simulator` button. The simulator will now appear as a separate application. Click the run arrow (this is the `SimpleSimulationControllerWidget` that was added to the  user interface back at step 24) and the model will run for 100 years (cf step 20).

| `tut1.dsl` | the configuration file we have been developing 
| `layout.dsl` | the visualisation of tut1.dsl for display in ModelMaker
| `MM.dsl` | the project preferences
| `userProject.jar` |java source and class files generated when we reached step 42 above
| `data.jar` | any data files used by the project. Empty for this tutorial
| `simulator.jar` | a manifest of the above jars plus threeWorlds.jar and its dependencies. This is the jar that runs at step 43 above
| `local/java` | the java files and classes added to userProject.jar
| `local/runTime` | created when running the simulator for the first time
| `preferences.dsl` | preferences for the simulator – window size and position of controls etc...
| `init-default.twg` | a text file containing the starting state of all state variables. We only have one in this tutorial : `x`
| `param-default.twg` | a text file containing all parmeters. We only have one in this tutorial : `k`

You can open the java files in a text editor (`local/java/code/tut1/ecology/*.java`) to see what `ModelMaker` has created. `Pars.java` is an implementation of the Pars record and contains the field `k`. Likewise `Vars.java` contains the field `x`. These two files are always generated by `ModelMaker`. _If you edit them in any way, your edits will be overwritten by_ `ModelMaker`. The third file, `Step.java`, is a _template_ file. We will edit this file later in https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[eclipse] to implement the Chaos equation above. 

WARNING: Don’t try and edit in a simple text editor as `ModelMaker` will rely on https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[eclipse] to compile and create the associated class file. In https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[eclipse] you can edit this file as you please as long as you don’t change its  Java class.

You may be surprised to find there is little you can do with the simulator except run, pause, continue and reset a simulation: that is, all you can do essentially, is run the experiment and examine the results.  The one other thing you can do is pause the simulation and save the current state to a new initial state file.

*[TODO: rewrite the initial state stuff - points 44 and 45]*

Note that the contents of the initial state file are determined by the project configuration file (`tut1.dsl`). Changes to the configuration, specifically records and tables defined under the `codeSource` category, will result in changes to the initial state file. The simulator will attempt to handle this and issue warnings where differences have been encountered. You should deal with these warnings before relying on your results.

It's no use running the simulator again at the moment because we have yet to implement the chaos equation. This is were we begin writing Java code in https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[eclipse]. 

[start=46]
. Open eclipse, create a workspace (if you have not already done so) and create a new Java project called `Chaos`. We should probably call it the same name as our 3Worlds project (`tut1`)  but at the moment it is simpler to give it a different name to distinguish between Java projects and ModelMaker projects in this tutorial. However, naming the Java and 3Worlds project the same, will help avoid confusion when you have many projects..

. We first need to add the 3Worlds libraries to the Chaos project. Right-click on the `Chaos` project and select `preferences`.

. Choose `Java Build Path` and select the `Libraries` tab.

. Open the `Add External Jars`, navigate to the `.3w` directory and include `threeWorlds.jar` and `tw-dep.jar`.

. Click `Ok` and close then `Apply` and `close`.

. **Linking `tut1` project to `Chaos` java project**: Open the `tut1` project in `ModelMaker` (if not already open).

. Select `Preferences - > Java Project - > connect`. Navigate to the workspace containing the `Chaos` project, select it and click `Open`. You will now see the main window title of `ModelMaker` has changed to indicate this link to the `Chaos` project. 

+

+
This link will be saved in the `MM.dsl` preferences file after quitting `ModelMaker`. If you link to some directory that is not an eclipse project, you will get an error message.

. Return to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[eclipse], right-click on the `Chaos` project and select `Refresh`. Under the `src` directory you will now see the three java files created previously by `ModelMaker`. These were transferred when the link was set in `ModelMaker`.

. Open `Step.java`. You will see this is a `ChangeStateFunction` class (cf.  38). If you change the type of function to something other than `ChangeState` in `ModelMaker`, this file, and any changes you have made to it, will be saved under a new name called `Step.orig_0`. This is to avoid the complications of trying to move your changes to a new file (where they may not in fact be appropriate) but without losing your work. The number will increment each time this situation happens *[NOT DONE YET]* to prevent overwrites.

. Add the following code within the `changeState()` method:
+
[source,java]
----
Pars pars = (Pars) focal.parameters();
Vars current = (Vars)focal.currentState();
Vars next = (Vars)focal.nextState();
next.x(pars.k()*current.x()*(1-current.x()));
----

. Save your work. Saving your java file will ensure eclipse creates the associated class file for inclusion in the simulator.jar when you next launch it from ModelMaker.

. *Plot the output*: Before running the simulator again, a final task is to display a time series of `x`. For this we must attach a _data tracker_ to `process:step`, modify a property to indicate the data to track and add a chart widget to the UI to view the time series.

. Right-click on `process:step` and create a new `dataTracker` node. Accept the defaults in the ensuing prompts. 

. A new task message will appear asking to set a valid value for `reporting period`. Go to the AEP and enter a value of 1 for this property. For reasons of efficiency, a dataTracker can buffer the data it collects and send it to a widget in fewer time steps. 

. In the AEP display, edit the dataTracker:dataTracker_1#track property and select the only available option: `x`. *[TODO]*

. Collapse all nodes and expand the userInterface node. From this node create a new `TopLeftPanel`.

. Select the `TopLeftPanel` node and create a widget. Name it `plot` and select `timeSeriesPlotWidgetfx` from 
the available list. You can add as many widgets as you like to a panel. Each will appear in its own tab.
There are 6 regions of the Simulator window where widgets can be placed: four panels (for large widgets): `TopLeftPanel`, `TopRightPanel`,
`BottomLeftPanel` and `BottomRightPanel`; and two toolbars (for small widgets): `ToolBarTop` and 
`ToolBarBottom`. This seems a good compromise between flexibility and ease of use.

. A new task message appears indicating this node must be connected to an `engine` node. This is to provide state
information from the `engine` to the `widget` so that, for example, the plot will be cleared when the engine is
reset (by the controller widget).

. We also need to connect to the `dataTracker`. This is not mandatory *[TODO WHY?]*, but nothing will show 
unless this is done. Right-click on the plot node and select `connect to -> channelListener - > dataTracker:dataTracker1`.

. Save your work and run the simulator. *[TODO screen capture]*
