Why another simulation environment for ecology?

_“Though the organisms may claim our primary interest, when we are trying to think fundamentally we cannot separate them from their special environment, with which they form
one physical system”_ A. G. Tanlsey (1935). 

Ecosystems, as first proposed by Arthur Tansley (1935), have both _physical_ and _biological_ aspects. They comprise
not only energy and chemical stocks and flows but also living things that are born, reproduce and die, exhibiting
particular behaviours over the course of their existence. They are made from and return to the physical world 
(dust to dust, ashes to ashes), are part of it and at one and the same time, they constitute an entire new world
where concepts such as reproduction, social interaction, communication, life cycle, but also death, dominate
the game. To this day, reconciling these two aspects remains a key problem in ecosystem 
studies: How does an energy flux translate into a number of living individuals or in a higher biodiversity? 
How does a particular reproduction strategy affect river hydrology and the regional water budget (e.g. the beaver)? 
How do social interactions affect the frequency of hurricanes (e.g. climate change)? 
*3Worlds* aims at providing _a tool for building simulations that couple the physical and biologial aspects of ecosystems_.
Existing tools are either (1) focusing on the physics (e.g. dynamic models based on differential equations) and can
only represent reproduction and growth with metaphors for continuous physical quantities (e.g. matrix population
models); or (2) focusing on the biology (e.g. multi-agent systems describing social interactions in detail but posing
difficulties to balance a mass or energy budget).

In addition to this physical and biological duality, ecosystems are '_multi-scale_' (cf. an extensive discussion on
this topic and other questions related to the ecosystem concept in Gignoux et al. 2011). The ecosystem definition
applies equally well to the whole biosphere as to a single bacteria in a drop of water. Currently, there is no
software enabling one to consider ecosystems at such different spatial and temporal scales within the same
conceptual framework. A second aim of *3Worlds* is to fill this gap. If the ecosystem concept is robust enough, and
we believe it is given its success in ecology and its spread in other scientific fields, then it should be possible
to design a conceptually sound and consistent computing framework to deal with a multiplicity of scales.

Changing the scale of a model is not only a matter of space and time resolution relative to an order of magnitude.
It also involves the level of detail of the representations used in the model, something which has been formalized
in _abstraction theory_ (Zucker 2003): the more detail there is in a model, the less abstract it is. At what 
 level of detail should we model our system to capture its important behaviour? How does changing scale (in the 
 broadest sense) effect model outcomes? There is no general answer to this question. This makes the possibility
 to test and compare different representations of the same system at different scales a must-have feature of
 any software dealing with ecosystems. *3Worlds* provides _a maximal flexibility in ecosystem representation_
 enabling to represent _any_ ecosystem at _any_ spatial and temporal scale with _any_ level of detail -- all this being set by
 the end-user in accordance with the purpose of their study. The end-user has full control on the detailed biological functions 
and variables relevant to their problem.
 
How is this compatible with the strong conceptual backbone to build required by the previous demand for easy change
between scales? *3Worlds* uses _aspect-oriented thinking (AOT)_ (Flint 2006), a method to build complex systems (e.g.
software) from independent areas of knowledge. We have designed an _archetype_ of what we believe constitutes an 
ecosystem -- a recursive and multi-scale system of interacting entities. We use an implementation of AOT to make sure
that any user-defined representation of an ecosystem complies with the archetype. This guarantees that, despite a 
great freedom left to the end-user, their model will always be compatible with the 3Worlds software. The great 
benefit of this is that while we believe it’s possible to construct any type of 
model within this archetype, imposing specification constraints greatly assists in model comparison: why should 
two models, ostensibly constructed for the same purpose, differ in their outputs? How does a change in temporal 
or spatial scale affect projections?  How does adding or removing sub-systems change model projections?
_Models developed in *3Worlds* are always comparable_, different to what usually
happens in large model intercomparison exercises.

The ecosystem is a recursive concept (Gignoux et al. 2011): ecosystems can be nested. Parts of an ecosystem can
be studied as ecosystems themselves. We use the concept of a hierarchical system, formalized as a graph (Gignoux et
al. 2017) to implement this idea. In *3Worlds*, _the modelled ecosystem is a graph_ where nodes represent relevant 
entities: individuals, populations, climate, soil, area, ...; and edges represent relations between these entities.
These relations can be of any kind, including a hierarchical relation describing the complex nesting of sub-systems. 
This provides an elegant solution to the apparent complexity of ecosystems: it allows for various types of _emergence_,
enables the comparison of system structures and simulation trajectories, and can represent virtually anything
an ecological modeller can dream of.

How is this possible in one single software? Well, *3Worlds* builds upon more than thirty years of experience of
its developers in ecosystem and complex system modelling and simulation. Over this time, we reached the conclusion that (1) robust concepts
are fundamental for building sound software, (2) some problems that appear over and over again in the life of a
simulation modellers often have well-established solutions, sometimes in other scientific fields, (3) complex
systems are not _that_ complex once properly designed. Things are just
available around here, it's just a matter of making them work together, and *3Worlds* is our best try to do so!
