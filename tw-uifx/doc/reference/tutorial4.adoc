=== Elaborating the model structure: Testing the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis

==== Introduction

In this tutorial we add a disturbance to effect the community of plants modelled with the competitive Lotka-Volterra equation used in Tutorial 3. This will provide a tool to examine the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH). 

In the tutorial following this, we will modify these specifications to make a cleaner design.

==== Specifications

The quickest way to begin is to start a new project using Tutorial 3.

. Create a new project from on `Tutorials -> 4 LotkaVolterra` and name it "Tut4".

. Collapse all nodes except for the `dataDefinition` sub-tree re-apply the layout.
