# A 3Worlds-openMole 'model' is a jar consisting all unpacked classes of:
# tw-<os>.jar; MyModel.jar; 
# MyModel.utg and bespoke generated OpenMoleRun.java probably to be placed in MyModel.jar.
# This can all be done by ModelMaker

below is all crap!
Temp cmds for now: Note jars cannot be included in jars - the whole jar must be packed i.e. like tw-setup but including MyModel.jar and the utg file.

The proper way seems to be building a bundle with maven?? cf openMole java notes.
mkdir testom
# copy the above files to testom or set paths where appropriate. It would be best to avoid copying!

cd testom
javac -cp "./tw-linux.jar:Logistic1.jar" OpenMoleRun.java
cd ..
jar cvf TestOm.jar testom

#TestOm.jar is now the 'model' to load into OpenMole
