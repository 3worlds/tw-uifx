ModelMaker is one part of the 3Worlds software suite. It is used for constructing ecosystem models: models that in our view, accord with Tansley's original meaning of the term 'Ecosystem'. 

Using the formalism of a graph, the structure of any ecosystem model can be defined by identifying all relevant components (nodes), their relationships (edges) and their attributes (properties). Code templates, generated by ModelMaker, provide the means of entering program code that defines the behaviour of these elements.

At the heart of this process is an archetype, a meta-model of what constitutes an ecosystem. In effect, the 3Worlds archetype makes concrete our interpretation of Tansley’s 1939 paper, namely, that an ‘ecosystem’ is a recursive and multi-scale system of interacting entities.

3Worlds makes the cycle of model development, analysis and refinement more efficient. More importantly however, by defining an ecosystem structure that complies with the 3Worlds archetype, arbitrary models no longer have arbitrary designs. This makes answering common but difficult modelling questions far more tractable. Questions such as:
  Why should two models, ostensibly constructed for the same purpose, differ in their outputs?
  How does a change in temporal or spatial scale affect model behaviour?
  How does adding or removing sub-systems change model behaviour? 
can only be addressed if the structure of models to be compared have a common understanding of what constitutes an ‘Ecosystem’.
